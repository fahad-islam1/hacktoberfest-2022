        <p><strong>
                What is HTML?
            </strong>
            <br>
            To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation: <br>
            Hypertext: <br> Text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related
            items <br>
            Markup: <br> A style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format <br>
            Language: <br> A language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands. <br>
            HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good
            and interactive.

        <h2>Css</h2>
        <p><strong>What is css</strong> <br> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the coding language that gives
            a
            website its look and layout. <br> Along with
            HTML, CSS is fundamental to web design. Without it, websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds.

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p><strong>What is Javascript</strong>
            <br>
            JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you
            to make web
            pages interactive. <br> Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, <br>
            JavaScript gives web
            pages interactive elements that engage a user.
